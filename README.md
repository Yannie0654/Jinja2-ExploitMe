# Jinja2-ExploitMe

Clone this repo to begin the SSTI exploit activity in [ACS 3230](https://github.com/Tech-at-DU/ACS-3230-Web-Security/master/Lessons/ServerSideExploits.md).

## Setup

1. Create a [new GitHub repo](https://github.com/new) and name it `Jinja2-ExploitMe`
2. Clone the [Jinja2-ExploitMe](https://github.com/Tech-at-DU/Jinja2-ExploitMe) repository
3. Run `git remote rm origin` in your local copy
4. Replace it using your new GitHub URL: `git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO_NAME`
5. Create a virtual environment for the project: `python3 -m venv venv`
6. Activate the virtual environment: `source venv/bin/activate`
7. Install the requirements `pip install -r requirements.txt`

   IMPORTANT: DO NOT USE pip3! ALWAYS use pip and python with an activated virtual environment.

8. Run `export FLASK_ENV=development; flask run` to get started! Be sure to read the instructions on the sidebar.
9. Be sure to activate the virtual environment each time you work on the project.
